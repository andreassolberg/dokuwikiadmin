This project is a simple administrative interaface for managing multiple DokuWiki subspaces. It allows all users to create new wikis and setup access control.

Feel free to use the application, but please modify the theme to not represent UNINETT if you do so. The project is not currently made very generic, but is specificly written for a single deployment at UNINETT OpenWiki. It may not be very easy to install, and there is no documentation on how to install it.
